# **Lab 1: Build a plan and canvas app** **for a real estate solution with Copilot in Power Apps**

**Objective**: In this lab, you will use Copilot in Power Apps to design
and implement a real estate solution. You will create a structured plan
that defines business requirements, processes, data tables, and
technology components, and then generate a canvas app that surfaces and
manages real estate showings.

## **Exercise 1: Create a plan**

1.  Sign in to Power Apps at **https://make.powerapps.com/** with your
    Office 365 tenant credentials.

2.  Ensure that you are in your developer environment - **Dev One**. If
    not, click on the environment selector and select **Dev One**.

> **Summary**: In this lab, you learnt to build a real estate showing
> management solution. You created a plan in the Power Apps portal,
> where Copilot analyzes a business prompt to identify user roles,
> processes, and data requirements. You learnt to review and refine the
> generated data model, including validating and updating table columns
> such as the Status choice field in the Showing table and created a
> **canvas app** directly from the generated plan.
