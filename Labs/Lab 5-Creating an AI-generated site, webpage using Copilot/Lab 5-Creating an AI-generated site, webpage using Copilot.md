Lab 5: Creating an AI-generated site, webpage using Copilot (preview)
and adding other components to pages

**Note:** When creating a Power Pages website using Copilot, it is
important to note that Copilot may generate a different template or
layout each time the website is created. As a result:

\- The exact layout and design of the generated website may vary from
one instance to another.

\- While following the creation steps in guides or tutorials, use them
as a reference rather than expecting identical results.

\- The screenshots provided may differ from what you see in your
instance due to Copilot's dynamic generation capabilities.

**Tip**: Focus on understanding the overall process and concepts rather
than replicating the exact design, as the core functionality and steps
will remain consistent.
